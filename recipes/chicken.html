  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Chicken fried bacon is breaded with seasoned flour and deep-fried until golden and crispy. Serve it with ranch dressing for dipping.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Peanut oil</li>
    <li>Thick cut bacon</li>
    <li>Seasoning Blend</li>
    <li>Seasoning flour</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Paprika</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack inside.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Meanwhile, cut bacon in half crosswise and season evenly on both sides with multi-purpose seasoning.</li>
    <li>Whisk together flour, salt, pepper, and paprika in a shallow bowl. Alternatively, season flour with additional multi-purpose seasoning blend. Whisk eggs, beer, and syrup together in a separate shallow bowl.</li>
    <li>Coat each piece of bacon lightly in seasoned flour. Then coat in egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip off. Coat once more in flour mixture; set aside until all pieces are coated and oil is hot.  </li>
    <li>Working a few pieces at a time, fry each piece in hot oil, flipping occasionally, until crispy golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Maintain the oil temperature between 330 and 350 degrees F (165 to 175 degrees C) while cooking. Drain bacon on the prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining bacon.    </li>
    <li>Serve with ranch dressing for dipping.</li>
  </ol>
